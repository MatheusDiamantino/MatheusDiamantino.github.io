Currently I&rsquo;m programming random games for learning purposes and studying Computer Graphics by my own. The OpenGL waters are DEEP AND I&rsquo;M DROWNING HELP. I&rsquo;m also starting to research Deep Learning topics and have worked in a few projects about it during the CE course.
Besides that, I try to create some pixel art from time to time and think about stories, plots and mechanics to fit the games I dream of making." />

<p>Besides that, I try to create some pixel art from time to time and think about stories, plots and mechanics to fit the games I dream of making. Game Design is very very interesting!</p>
